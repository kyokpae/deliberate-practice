Dithering
=========
Nowadays computer screens can display millions of colors. That wasn't the case until the late 90's. Before that life wasn't so colorful. For example original [Amiga's graphic chip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set) was capable of displaying only up to 32 colors and the further back you look the less colors you'll see.

Obviously programmers were trying to overcome these limitations. [Dithering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithering) for instance allows to create an illusion of a larger color pallete by proper application of noise.

In this kata I explored HTML5 canvas functionality and [Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floydâ€“Steinberg_dithering).
